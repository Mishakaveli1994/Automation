Theoretical questions:

What are the benefits of using Python language as a language,what are it's drawbacks?
- Benefits:
	It's close to natural human language.
	It has great support.
	Portability.
	Scalability.
	It's used in wide range of applications.
	
  Drawbacks:
	Slower than others.
	Poor graphical libraries support.

What is the difference between a Tuple and List in Python?
- Tuples are immutable data type - once created, they cannot be changed. Lists are mutable - they may be changed in size and content inside. 

Is Indentation Required in Python?
- Yes. It defines the code blocks.

Difference between for loop and while loop in Python.
- For loop has fixed number of iterations. While loop may have various number of iteration until a condition satisfied, thus it could end up in an endless loop.

What is List Comprehension, why do we need it and is it fasterthan a loop for list creation? Give an Example.
- List Comprehension may have a shorter syntax but may become hard to read for others. Can't remember its performance compared to normal For loop.
	new_list = [x for x in data_list if x >= 10]

What are unit tests in Python?
- Unit test are meant to test a single function by assertion of data.

What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deepcopy?
- Can't remember.

What are Decorators?
- Decorators add functionality to an existing function. 

When a parameter is passed to a function, is it by value (copy)or reference (pointer) ?
- AFAIK it's by value, i.e. copy. `Notes`: Only simple types like int, str, float are passed by value. Collections (list, dict, tuple etc.) are passed by reference. You can check it with the below code:

```
# Python function argument pass
x = 5
y = [1,2,3,4,5]

def test_argument_change(num:int, l:list):
    num += 1
    l.append(6)

test_argument_change(x,y)

print(x)
print(y)
```

The original list gets changed without a return statement.

Does Python support multiple Inheritance (OOP)?
- Sure. :-)
